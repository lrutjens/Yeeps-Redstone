## Genral terms
- Diagram - using a key (standard seen bellow) there will be a diagram below, there will also be a perspective reference such as "Birds-Eye"

B = Bomb
N = Normal block, could be a 1x1 or bigger
I = indestructible block, could be 1x1 or bigger
More could be added to each diagram
## Methods of gates
Note - for new method to be added, it should be able to be converted to the list bellow (like how a player can hit a bomb, and a bomb can bush a player.)
- ### [Yellow Bombs](https://github.com/lrutjens/Yeeps-Redstone/blob/main/Main.md#yellow-bombs-1)

- ### [Players](https://github.com/lrutjens/Yeeps-Redstone/blob/main/Main.md#Players-1)
Using players we can throw them around, using pearls, launch pads, and exploding them precisely


# Yellow Bombs
Using yellow bombs we can chain them together to make wiring.
Each bombs has a radius of 5, So looking at this diagram (x = exploded block) we can se how far a bomb may reach:
NNNxxxxBxxxxNNN

# Players
Using players we can throw them around, using pearls, launch pads, and exploding them precisely
